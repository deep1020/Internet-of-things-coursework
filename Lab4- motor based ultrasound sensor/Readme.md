1. In this exercise, you will create a Python program to collect distance from the ultrasound sensor dataand turn the servo motor based on the ultrasound sensor data.
2. Install an ultrasound sensor and a servo motor on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Write a program to collect distance data from the ultrasound sensor.
4. In your program,
    - Turn the servo motor clockwise if the distance is less than 30 CM.
    - Turn the servo motor counter-clockwise if the distance exceeds 30 CM.
    
5. Run the Python program
6. Extend the exercise as follows:
    - Blink a red LED and turn the motor clockwise when the distance is less than 30 CM.
    - Turn on a blue LED and turn the motor count-clockwise when the distance is more than 30CM.
