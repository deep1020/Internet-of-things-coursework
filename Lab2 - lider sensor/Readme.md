1. In this exercise, you will create a Python program to collect lidar sensor data and turn the LED on/offbased on the sonar sensor data.
2. Install a lidar sensor on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Write a program to collect distance data from the lidar.
4. In your program,
    - Turn on the red LED if the distance is less than 20 CM.
    - Turn off the red LED if the distance exceeds 20 CM.
    - Turn on the green LED if the distance exceeds 20 CM.
    - Turn off the green LED if the distance is less than 20 CM.
5. Run the Python program
6. Extend the exercise as follows: Blink red LED when the distance is less than 20 CM.
