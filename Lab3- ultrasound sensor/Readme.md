1. In this exercise, you will create a Python program to collect distance data from the ultrasound sensorand turn the LED on/off based on the ultrasound sensor data.
2. Install an ultrasound sensor on the Raspberry Pi.
3. Write a program to collect distance data from the ultrasound sensor.
4. In your program,
     - Turn on the red LED if the distance is less than 30 CM.
     - Turn off the red LED if the distance exceeds 30 CM.
     - Turn on the green LED if the distance exceeds 30 CM.
     - Turn off the green LED if the distance is less than 30 CM.
5. Run the Python program 
6. Extend the exercise as follows: Blink red LED when the distance is less than 30 CM.
